# Evaluating-Algorithm-Performance
This project is made to showcase the quick ability of quicksort and how it performs against insertion sort. It counts the average time taken for quicksort an insertion sort to sort random numbers taken from a text file, tested with various sizes. It also counts the number of comparisons between numbers are made with both sorting algorithms as well.<br> It outputs which sorting algorithm was used(I for insertion sort, Q for quicksort), the number of random numbers, the number of comparisons made, the calculation time, and then the expected worst case number of comparisons for both algorithms.

# Project Language and Dependencies 
Language: Ruby

The benchmark library is used to find the time calculation. No other libraries were used for this project
